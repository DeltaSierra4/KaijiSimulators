/*
 * class OnePokerSim ver 1.1.0
 *
 * Main executable of the One Poker Simulator program. Simulates a game of
 * 'One Poker' that is featured in Season 4 of the Japanese Manga 'Kaiji'.
 * Rules of the game: Each player draws 2 cards from a shuffled deck of
 * poker cards. When they do, they state whether they have 'two up', 'two down',
 * or 'one up one down', depending on what cards they have. The cards that
 * belong to each category are defined as the following:
 *
 * Down: All cards from 2 to 7
 * Up: All cards from 8 to K and Ace
 *
 * Suits are ignored in this game. In each round, each player plays a card
 * from their hand. Whoever has played the card with the higher value wins
 * that round and claims a life from the other player. For instance, if
 * player A plays 7 of hearts and player B plays 9 of spades, player B wins
 * that round; if player A plays Ace of spades and player B plays Jack of clubs,
 * then player A wins that round. This pattern wraps around the value 2:
 * If player A plays Ace of spades and player B plays 2 of clubs, then player B
 * wins that round. Only card 2 can beat the Ace cards (which are defined as
 * the card with the highest value in this game). In case of a draw, no lives
 * are exchanged. Cards that are already played are not returned to the original
 * deck. If the remaining deck is completely consumed, the used cards are
 * reshuffled and used again.
 *
 * In addition to choosing what card to play, the player can also decide if
 * they want to increase the bet by raising the bet by one more life. The
 * opponent can decide to fold, accept the raise, or bet an even higher amount.
 *
 * The number of starting lives for each player depends on how much money
 * each player starts with. In this program, the number of lives can be set
 * by the client by optional command line arguments. The game is over when one
 * player runs out of lives.
 *
 * How to run it:
 *    ./OnePokerSim [-s <setting>] [-pl <player's life count>] [-ol <opponent's life count>]
 * setting = 1 for 'Kaiji setting': player starts with 2 lives and computer
 * starts with 10 lives
 * setting = 2 for custom settings: Client can choose life count for each
 * player
 * If no arguments are used, game will proceed with default settings
 * of 10:10 life count
 *
